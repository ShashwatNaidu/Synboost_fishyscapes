# Pixel-wise Anomaly Detection for Complex Outdoors Scenes
This repository is the paper implementation of Pixel-wise Anomaly Detection for Complex Outdoors Scenes (`HYPER-LINK PAPER`). 

### Installation

In order to set-up the project, please follow these steps:
1) Run  `git clone https://github.com/giandbt/driving_uncertainty.git`. 
2) Download pre-trained models using `https://dissimilarity.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/models.tar`. 
De-compress file and save inside the repository
3) We need to install Apex (https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) running the following:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex
    cd apex
    pip install -v --no-cache-dir ./
    ```
4) Install all the neccesary python modules with `pip install -r requirements_demo.txt`

### Datasets 
The repository uses the Cityscapes Dataset [X] as the basis of the training data for the dissimilarity moodel. 
To download the dataset please register and follow the instructions here: https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/


### Training 
The anomaly pipeline uses pre-trained models for segmentation and image re-synthesis. 
You can find this pre-trained models using `wget https://dissimilarity.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/models.tar`. 
Additionally, you can refer to the original repositories. 

In order to trained the dissimilarity network, we have to do the following:
TODO

### Evaluation
The repository already includes some sample images to test the pipeline, which are found under `./sample_images/`. 
In order to run inference in these images, run the following command: `python demo.py`

In case custom images want to be tested change the `--demo-folder` flag. Information about all the other flags can be 
found running `demo.py -h`.

### Google Colab Demo Notebook
A demo of the anomaly detection pipeline can be found here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HQheunEWYHvOJhQQiWbQ9oHXCNi9Frfl?usp=sharing#scrollTo=gC-ViJmm23eM

### ONNX Conversion 

You can download the onnx conversion for the segmentation, synthesis and dissimilarity by running 
`wget https://dissimilarity.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/demo_files.tar` 

In order to convert all three models into `.onnx`, it is neccesary to update the `symbolic_opset11.py` file from the
original `torch` module installation. The reason for this is that `torch==1.4.0` does not have compatibility for `im2col`
which is neccesary for the synthesis model. 

Simply copy the `symbolic_opset11.py` from this repository and replace the one from the torch module inside your project environment. 
The file is located `/Path/To/Enviroment/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/onnx`

### Notes 

- The image segmentaion folder is heavily based on [1], specifically commit `b4fc685`. Additionally, 
the image synthesis folder is based on [2]. specifically commit `0486b08`. For light weight version of the segmentation
model, we used the code from ``, and also Pix2PixHD commit ``
